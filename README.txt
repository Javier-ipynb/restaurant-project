# Project Title:
Prediction of Total Restaurant Sales

# Description:
Using the data we obtained, the objective is to create a machine learning model to predict the potential total annual sales of a restaurant. Additionally, we will study some factors that might influence this objective.

# Data Acquisition:
The data was obtained for free from the Kaggle website. The dataset is for educational and free use, meaning the data could be synthetic and might not represent the reality of a population.

# Final Model Performance for the Project:
This project identifies clear patterns and correlations between certain variables, resulting in a nearly perfect model. This was achieved after conducting thorough exploratory data analysis to verify the best features for training the model.
